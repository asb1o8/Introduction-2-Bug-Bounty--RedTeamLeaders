## Port and Service Scanning: Beyond HTTP

#### 🌳 Why Port Scanning Matters:-
Typical Risks:
- Development servers running on non-standard/high ports
- Internal administration panels accessible on ports like 8080, 3000, or 5000
- Unprotected databases (e.g., MongoDB, Elasticsearch, Redis)
- Weak default services left open (such as Telnet, FTP, SMB)


#### 🌳 Use Fast, Wide-Range Scanners

For wide scans:
masscan: Extremely fast, used for Internet-wide scans.(github.com/robertdavidgraham/masscan)


    Example: masscan -p1-65535 <target_ip> --rate=1000


#### 🌳 Move to Deep Scanning with Nmap

After identifying open ports:
Use nmap for banner grabbing, version detection, and script scanning


    Example: nmap -sV -sC -p22,80,443,8080 <target_ip>  

Enable -sC to run default scripts (great for detecting vulnerable services).


#### 🌳 Understand Common Non-HTTP Ports:-
Notable ports and associated services:
- 21: FTP
- 22: SSH
- 23: Telnet
- 25, 465, 587: SMTP
- 110, 143: POP/IMAP
- 3306: MySQL
- 5432: PostgreSQL
- 6379: Redis
- 9200: Elasticsearch
- 27017: MongoDB  
- 8080, 8443, 8000, 8888: Dev servers

Knowing these helps prioritize targets.


#### 🌳 Banner Grabbing and Service Identification

Identify what is running using:

    nmap -sV
    nc (Netcat)
    curl or wget on web-based ports

Banner info reveals:

    Software versions
    Server types
    Leaky headers (e.g., X-Powered-By, Server)



#### 🌳 Enumerate Web Services on Alternative Ports
- Run HTTP probes on ports like 8080, 8000, 5000, 3000, 8888.
- Oftenly they host node.js dashboards, jenkins and phpMyAdmin.

To quickly identify HTTP services on non-standard ports use:

   httpx, naabu, or httprobe 



#### 🌳 Analyze TLS/SSL on Any Port:-
- sslscan/testssl.sh to inspect SSL/TLS on 443, 8443, or any SSL port
- SSL misconfigurations can reveal dev/test environments or even allow MITM.


#### 🌳 Correlate Open Ports to Subdomains:-

Combine service data with subdomain mapping:
- A subdomain may resolve to an IP with services on ports 22, 8080, and 27017.
- Helps identify which application or microservice exposes which ports.

Example:

    dev-api.target.com → IP: 1.2.3.4 → Ports 443, 8080 → Jenkins exposed?


#### 🌳 Log and Visualize Network Maps:- 
Track:
- Which IPs have which ports open
- What services run on which hosts
- How assets are distributed by environment (prod, staging, dev)

Tools like:

    Amass (with visual graph output)
    Nmap with -oX output + visualization tools


#### 🌳 Watch for Default Credentials and Misconfigurations:-
- Port and Service scanning typically uncover the forgotten doors. A large number of critical vulnerabilities
  arise beyond the standard web stack — such as an overlooked Redis service, a Jenkins panel left with default
  logins, or a development API exposed on port 8000. The ability to investigate these areas provides bug hunters
  with an advantage where most others give up.
