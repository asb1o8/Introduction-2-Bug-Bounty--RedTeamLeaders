## Content Discovery: Hidden Endpoints and Sensitive Directories

- Introduction:- Content discovery — often referred to as forced browsing — focuses on uncovering resources
  that aren’t linked publicly yet remain accessible, such as hidden paths, admin panels, or forgotten files.
  This stage frequently exposes sensitive sections that may contain exploitable weaknesses.

#### 🌳 Why Content Discovery Matters:-
Hidden content may include:

    /admin/, /internal/, /backup.zip
    API endpoints like /v1/private/users
    Feature toggles or staging versions


#### 🌳 Use Wordlists Strategically
Popular sources:

    github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists: common.txt, raft-medium-directories.txt
    github.com/assetnote/discovery-data
    Custom lists based on recon data and technologies used



#### 🌳 Tools for Directory and File Brute-Forcing:- 

Core tools:

    ffuf: Fast, supports fuzzing multiple parameters
    dirsearch: Supports extensions, filters, recursion
    feroxbuster: Fast, parallel, recursive scanning
    gobuster: Simple and effective


Example:

ffuf -u https://target.com/FUZZ -w common.txt -mc 200,403


- Focus on status codes like 200, 401, 403, and sometimes 302.



#### 🌳 Don’t Just Look for Directories — Look for Files

Files are as important as folders.

Common file types:

    .bak, .old, .zip, .swp
    .env, .git/config, .DS_Store
    debug.log, error.log, composer.lock

These can reveal credentials, source code, or system structure.


#### 🌳 Target Parameter-Based Endpoints:-

Some hidden functionality isn’t based on URL paths but on parameters:

    /view.php?id=2
    /download?file=backup.zip
    /api/v1/private?auth=false

Fuzz query parameters and parameter names.

Use:

    ffuf with -u https://site.com/page.php?FUZZ=value
    Wordlists like parameters.txt from SecLists


#### 🌳 Recursive Discovery Yields Deep Insights:-

Tools like ffuf and feroxbuster allow recursive fuzzing:

    Find /admin/
    Then scan inside it: /admin/FUZZ

Recursive mode helps expose hidden dashboards, staging folders, and API documentation.

#### 🌳 Extensions Matter:-

Try fuzzing with different extensions:

    .php, .aspx, .html, .json, .js, .bak, .zip, .tar.gz

Many endpoints are only accessible with specific extensions, or old versions are left behind with .bak.

ffuf -u https://site.com/FUZZ -w wordlist.txt -e .php, .bak, .zip


#### 🌳 Monitor for Rate Limiting and WAF Detection:-

Heavy content discovery can trigger:

    IP bans
    429 Too Many Requests
    WAF challenge pages

Tips:

    Use delays (-p 0.5)
    Rotate IPs or proxies


#### 🌳 JS Files Contain Valuable Hidden Routes:-

Manually reviewing JS files often reveals:

    Internal API endpoints
    Admin routes
    Feature toggles or flags

Use tools like:

    LinkFinder
    JSParser
    Manual grep and pattern matching

Combine content discovery with endpoint mining from JS.
    Respect robots.txt (at least initially)


#### 🌳 Create a Content Map per Target:-

Track:

    Paths discovered
    Access status
    Authenticated vs unauthenticated access
    Whether content changes based on cookies or headers

This structured approach makes it easier to revisit targets, automate alerts, or escalate findings.

##### Conclusion:- 
- Content discovery turns a static domain into a living attack map. While many focus only on 
what’s visible, experienced bug hunters brute-force, investigate, and connect clues — uncovering endpoints 
that were intended to remain hidden. Just one overlooked directory can open the door to a complete application 
compromise.
