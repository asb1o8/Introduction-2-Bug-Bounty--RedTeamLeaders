## Leaked Secrets and OSINT Integration

#### 🌳 What Are Leaked Secrets?
- API keys (e.g., Stripe, Google Maps)
- Access tokens (JWTs, OAuth)
- Database credentials
- Private keys (SSH, RSA)
- Cloud credentials (AWS, Azure)

They may exist in:
- Public code repositories
- Paste sites
- JavaScript files
- Build artifacts


#### 🌳 Where Leaks Usually Appear:- 
Most common sources:
- GitHub/GitLab (pushed code, commits)
- Js loaded on production sites
- Misconfigured storage buckets (S3, GCP, Azure)
- Pastebin clones or private bin leaks
- Mobile apps (APK/IPA reverse engineering)
- Public forums (Slack exports, DockerHUb, CI/CD logs etc.)


#### 🌳 Using OSINT to Identify Targets:-
Effective OSINT uncovers:
- Use Hunter.io to find company emails
- Correlate with GitHub users
- Monitor those users’ repos for secrets


#### 🌳 Tools for Secret Hunting:- 
- TruffleHog: Scans Git history for secrets using entropy and regex
- Gitleaks: Finds hardcoded credentials in code
- Shhgit: Real-time GitHub secret scanner
- Gitrob: Maps GitHub repos to employees for targeted scanning

For mobile apps:
- apktool, jadx, or mobSF to reverse engineer APKs and find embedded keys


#### 🌳 Combining Tools with Target Intelligence:-
- Identify target developers via LinkedIn/GitHub
- Scrape their public GitHub repos
- Run TruffleHog or Gitleaks on cloned repos
- Extract and test secrets or endpoints found
- Report verified impact


#### 🌳 Pastebin and Paste Sites Monitoring:-
Secrets often appear in pastes like:
- Pastebin
- Ghostbin
- Rentry
- Hastebin

Use:
- Manual keyword searches (target.com, password)
- RSS feeds for automation
- PasteHunter or LeakLooker for aggregation

Be cautious with legality depending on data accessed.


#### 🌳 Search Engines and Aggregators:- 
Platforms for the structured search of unstructured leaks:- 
- PublicWWW
- Hunter.io
- BuiltWith
- Censys.io for certificates revealing subdomains
- LeakIX for exposed services and secrets

#### 🌳 Finding Secrets in JavaScript and Source Maps:-
Look for:
- Unminified .js files
- Exposed .map files (source maps)
- Comments or console logs with debug info
- Tokens in fetch/XHR calls or headers

Example:

         fetch('https://api.target.com/user', {
         headers: { Authorization: 'Bearer sk_live_...' }
         })


#### 🌳 Monitoring Leaks Over Time:-
Leaks happen continuously. Automate monitoring by:
- Setting up GitHub webhooks
- Using RSS feeds for search queries
- Creating alerts with tools like Shhgit or GitGuardian
- Scraping developer activity regularly


#### 🌳 Testing and Validating Secrets:-
Always verify before reporting:
- Use Postman or curl to test API keys
- Check if database creds connect
- Validate cloud tokens via their CLI

Example test for API:

       curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <key>" https://api.target.com/v1/me
