## Subdomain Enumeration: Tools & Manual Techniques

#### 🌳 Subdomains Matters:- 
- A different server or application stack
- A staging or dev environment
- An API or mobile backend
- Forgotten or deprecated services

#### 🌳 Passive Enumeration Techniques:-
Main data sources:

    Certificate Transparency logs (crt.sh, certspotter, Censys)
    DNS databases (SecurityTrails, DNSDumpster)
    Public threat intelligence feeds
    Search engines (e.g., site:target.com)
    GitHub repos and mentions

Tools:

    Subfinder (by ProjectDiscovery)
    Amass (in passive mode)
    crt.sh scripts
    Chaos dataset (by ProjectDiscovery)

#### 🌳 Active Enumeration Techniques:
- DNS brute-force using wordlists
- Permutation and mutation-based techniques
- DNS resolution to identify live hosts

Tools:

    Amass (active mode)
    dnsx
    massdns
    puredns

#### 🌳 Wordlists Matter

Effective lists:

    SecLists (dns/subdomains-top1million-5000.txt)
    assetnote/discovery-data
    Custom lists based on known company structures (dev, staging, internal, uat, etc.)

 #### 🌳 Recursive and Permutation Discovery

Many tools support recursive scanning:
- Discover dev.api.example.com after api.example.com

Permutation tools (e.g., dnsgen, alterx) help uncover variations:
- www-staging, old-login, auth-v2


#### 🌳 Validate with DNS Resolution
Not every subdomain you find is live. Use tools like:

    dnsx (by ProjectDiscovery)
    massdns (bulk resolution)
    httpx (check HTTP response)

#### 🌳 Bruteforce Smartly, Not Blindly

Blindly brute-forcing with massive lists is noisy and inefficient.

- Use tiered wordlists (small → medium → large)
- Filter known dead patterns
- Respect rate limits

#### 🌳 Discovering Wildcard DNS

- Some companies use wildcard DNS (*.example.com resolves everywhere), which poisons brute-force results.
- Send random subdomains and check if they resolve
- Use tools like massdns with wildcard filtering logic

#### 🌳 Manual Enrichment of Subdomains
- use httpx, whatweb, naabu

#### 🌳 Organize and Reuse:
- Use tools that export in JSON, CSV or HTML
- Tag by timestamp, domain, tool used
- Store in recon platforms (e.g., ReconFTW, custom dashboards)
