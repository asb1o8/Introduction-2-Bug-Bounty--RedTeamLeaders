##  Monitoring GitHub and Other Public Repositories
- Introduction= Open repositories on platforms like GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, and others frequently contain
                valuable sensitive data. Developers may unintentionally commit API keys, internal endpoints,
                login credentials, or proprietary code. Actively tracking these sources in real time can uncover
                significant findings.

#### 🌳 Why GitHub Monitoring Works?
Developers make mistakes:
- Accidentally commit .env, config.php, .git-credentials
- Forget to remove debugging code
- Push old internal tools that still work

Companies cannot fully sanitize all public contributions. As a result, secrets and clues leak.


#### 🌳 Common Targets and Files of Interest:-
Look for:
- .env, .gitignore, .npmrc
- config.js, database.yml, settings.py
- API clients and SDKs
- Backup files (db.bak, export.sql)

Search for keywords like:

    password=, apikey=, secret=, token=
    Authorization, AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID, PRIVATE_KEY


#### 🌳 Search Techniques and Dorks:-
Use GitHub dorks to find exposed content. Example searches:

    org:target-company password
    org:target-company "Authorization: Bearer"
    org:target-company filename:.env
    targetcompany.com "api_key"

GitHub's advanced search UI or the API for automation are quite useful.


#### 🌳 Tools for GitHub Recon:- 
Popular tools include:

    Truffle-Hog: Scans for secrets in Git history
    GitLeaks: Static analysis for secrets and sensitive files
    GitDorker: Automated GitHub dorking
    Repo-supervisor: Tracks risky commits in CI/CD
These are use to monitor specific organizations or keywords.


#### 🌳 Real-Time Monitoring with GitHub API:-
Use GitHub’s event API to stream new commits:
- Watch orgs or specific repos
- Filter by file types or commit message
- Alert when keywords appear

Advanced: Build a webhook to alert you via Discord or Slack.


#### 🌳 Leveraging GitHub Search Engines:-
Use platforms like:
- Publicwww.com for string-in-code search
- GitHub Search
- Hunt.io for leaked secrets
- Greynoise for dev [github.com/obheda12/GitHub-Secret-Scanner]

These sites offer indexed search and alerts.


#### 🌳 Monitoring Developer Activity
Track developers who contribute to your target:
- Use git log to find commit authors
- Follow them on GitHub to see forks and projects
- Look for leaked company domains in their repos

#### 🌳 Bitbucket, GitLab and Other Sources:-

Not everything lives on GitHub. Few of them survives here too:
- Bitbucket public projects
- GitLab (search.gitlab.com)
- SourceForge, Gitbucket

Tools like bb-recon or gitrob support alternative platforms.


#### 🌳 Correlating Findings to Active Assets:-
Link secrets or domains back to live infrastructure:
- API keys → test with curl or Postman
- Internal domains → probe for exposed dashboards
- Git repo URLs → check for .git folder leaks or open directories


#### 🌳 Ethics and Rules:-
Stay within scope:
- Only scan public data
- Do not brute-force private repos
- Follow platform ToS and program rules

Many bug bounty platforms allow public repo scanning if it’s tied to your target.


##### Monitoring GitHub is a high-signal recon method as it combines automation, OSINT, and creativity to uncover overlooked attack vectors.
