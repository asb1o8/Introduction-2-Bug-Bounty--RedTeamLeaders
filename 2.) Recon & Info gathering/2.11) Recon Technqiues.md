## One-Liners and Recon Techniques

One‑liners are concise commands that merge several actions into one run. They come in handy for rapid 
reconnaissance, linking tools together, or automating tasks without full scripts. Learning to use them 
  well makes you quicker, more streamlined, and more capable in practical recon work.
  

#### 🌳 Passive Subdomain Enumeration:- 

       curl -s "https://crt.sh/?q=%.target.com&output=json" | jq -r '.[].name_value' | sort -u

Scrapes subdomains from Certificate Transparency logs using crt.sh.


#### 🌳 Subdomain Discovery + Live Host Filtering:- 

       subfinder -d target.com -silent | httpx -silent

Finds subdomains and checks which ones are live using HTTP(S).


#### 🌳 Directory Brute-Forcing with ffuf:-

        ffuf -u https://target.com/FUZZ -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt -t 50 -mc 200,204,301,302,403

Finds hidden directories and files with common wordlists.


#### 🌳 JavaScript Endpoint Discovery:-

        curl -s https://target.com/app.js | grep -oE 'https?://[^"]+'

Extracts URLs from JS files to look for API endpoints or keys.


#### 🌳 JavaScript URL Parameter Mining:-

        curl -s https://target.com/app.js | grep -oP '\w+=\w+'

Finds parameter-style patterns which could lead to query injection points.


#### 🌳 GitHub Dorking for Secrets:-

         github-subdomains -d target.com | xargs -I{} sh -c 'echo {}; git clone https://github.com/{}'

Clones potential repos linked to the organization. Combine with trufflehog or gitleaks.


#### 🌳 CORS Misconfig Check:-

        curl -H "Origin: https://evil.com" -I https://target.com | grep "Access-Control-Allow-Origin"

Checks if CORS is misconfigured to allow arbitrary origins.


#### 🌳 JS File Map Discovery via Source Maps:-

      curl -s https://target.com/static/js/app.js.map | jq

If .map files are exposed, parse them to understand JS structure and hidden logic.


#### 🌳 Subdomain Takeover Detection:-

       subfinder -d target.com -silent | dnsx -a -resp-only | xargs -I{} curl -s -L {} | grep -Ei "NoSuchBucket|404|unavailable|heroku"

Combines subdomain scan + CNAME check + fingerprinting for takeover signs.


#### 🌳 Automated Nuclei Scanning on Live Hosts:-

      subfinder -d target.com -silent | httpx -silent | nuclei -t cves/ -o target_cves.txt

Scans target subdomains for known CVEs using Nuclei templates.


#### 🌳 Filter for Interesting Endpoints from Wayback:- 

        waybackurls target.com | grep -E '\.php|\.asp|\.jsp|\.json|\.action' | tee endpoints.txt

Finds potentially interesting legacy endpoints from archive.org.


#### 🌳 S3 Bucket Enumeration:-

       echo target | while read domain; do echo "https://$domain.s3.amazonaws.com"; done | httpx -mc 200,403

Tries to access S3-style URLs for public or restricted buckets.


#### 🌳 Identify Technologies in Use:-

        whatweb https://target.com

Provides quick tech stack fingerprinting for CMS, frameworks, server software, etc.


#### 🌳 Filter Live Assets by Status Code:-

       cat hosts.txt | httpx -status-code -mc 200,403,500 -silent

Returns only hosts responding with interesting HTTP codes.


#### 🌳 Port Scan Fast:-

        naabu -host target.com -p 1-10000

Quickly scans for open ports across a wide range.
