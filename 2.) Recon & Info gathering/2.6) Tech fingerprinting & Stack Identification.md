## Technology Fingerprinting and Stack Identification

Technology fingerprinting is the process of identifying the technologies a target uses across both frontend and backend. This knowledge enables a hunter to customize attacks and concentrate on known weaknesses.

#### 🌳 Why Fingerprinting Is Essential:- 

Each technology has its history of vulnerabilities.

Examples:

    WordPress → known plugin exploits
    Apache Struts → RCE history
    jQuery → XSS if outdated
    Laravel → debug mode exposures


#### 🌳 Start with HTTP Headers:- 

HTTP response headers can leak valuable information.

Examples:

    X-Powered-By: Express → Node.js backend
    Server: Apache/2.4.18 (Ubuntu)
    X-Drupal-Cache → Drupal
    X-Runtime, X-Request-ID → Ruby on Rails

Use curl -I, httpx, or browser dev tools to check.


#### 🌳 Analyze the HTML Source:-

Clues inside the HTML reveal:

    JS libraries and versions (ex- jquery-1.8.3.min.js)
    CMS meta tags (<meta name="generator" content="WordPress 5.5">)
    Webpack or React dev errors

Look for:
- File names, comments, hidden scripts
- Framework-specific markup or debugging elements


#### 🌳 Use Passive Fingerprinting Tools:-

Automated tools make this faster:

    WhatWeb: fingerprinting based on headers and content
    Wappalyzer: browser plugin or CLI
    BuiltWith: online service
    httpx -tech-detect: part of ProjectDiscovery


#### 🌳 Fingerprint JavaScript Frameworks:-

Frontend libraries can be detected by:
- Unique DOM elements or class names
- JS global variables (e.g., window.angular, window.__REACT_DEVTOOLS_GLOBAL_HOOK__)
- File paths (e.g., /static/js/bundle.js → React)



#### 🌳 Detect Backend Technologies:-
Sometimes backend clues are subtle. Look for:
- Error messages (NullPointerException, Parse error → PHP)
- Session cookie names (JSESSIONID, PHPSESSID, laravel_session)
- Time-based behavior under load (Node.js async timing patterns)

        Tools like nmap -sV, nuclei, and ffuf with extensions can help.


#### 🌳 Identify CMS and Framework Versions:-

Knowing versions allows for CVE-based exploitation.

How:
- Use wpscan for WordPress
- Check URLs for /core/modules/ → Drupal
- Enumerate routes and file structure
- Check known plugin paths

Correlate versions with exploit databases like Exploit-DB or CVE Details.


#### 🌳 Database Fingerprinting:-

Even without SQLi, tech stacks often reveal the backend DB:
- Headers like X-Sqlite-Version
- SQL errors from poorly handled input
- ORM usage patterns (e.g., Sequelize, ActiveRecord)

Knowing the DB helps you craft payloads during injection attacks or logic abuses.
