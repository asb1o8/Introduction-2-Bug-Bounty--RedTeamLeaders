## Automating Recon with Bash, Python and Recon Frameworks

#### 🌳 Why Automate Recon?
- Increases consistency across targets
- Saves hours of repetitive manual work
- Detects changes or new assets over time
- Enables multitarget recon at scale
- Lets you focus on analyzing results, not collecting them


#### 🌳 Bash Scripting for Recon:-
Example Bash script:

      #!/bin/bash
      domain=$1
      subfinder -d $domain -silent > subs.txt
      httpx -l subs.txt -silent > live.txt
      nuclei -l live.txt -silent -o results.txt

This script:
- Enumerates subdomains
- Filters for live hosts
- Scans them with Nuclei

#### 🌳 Python for Custom Logic & Integrations:-
Python is more flexible for:
- API interactions
- Parsing HTML/JSON
- Multi-threaded workflows
- Integrating multiple tools
- Ex- scrape GitHub using its API, then filter files for secrets.

Python libraries often used:

    requests
    subprocess
    argparse
    threading


#### 🌳 Recon Frameworks to Know:-
Widely-used recon frameworks include:
- ProjectDiscovery Suite: subfinder, httpx, dnsx, nuclei
- reconFTW: Automates entire recon chain
- TheReconator: Targets multiple domains simultaneously
- Hakluke’s recon scripts: Modular and bash-friendly

These frameworks orchestrate toolchains with minimal setup.


#### 🌳 Recon Frameworks to Know:-
Scheduling and Cron Jobs. Use cron to run recon daily or weekly:

       0 3 * * * /home/user/recon.sh target.com

Benefits:
- Tracks changes in attack surface
- Detects new subdomains, endpoints, secrets
- Can notify via email, Discord, or Slack

Useful for continuous recon in long-term programs.


#### 🌳 Notification and Alerting Systems:-
Don’t just write logs. Notify yourself:
- Use sendmail or mailx in bash
- Integrate with Discord webhooks or Slack bots
- Send Telegram messages using bots
- Push to GitHub/GitLab with timestamped diffs


#### 🌳 Building a Modular Recon Pipeline:-
- Step 1: Subdomain Enumeration
- Step 2: Probing live hosts
- Step 3: Screenshotting (aquatone, gowitness)
- Step 4: JS file scraping
- Step 5: Directory brute-force (ffuf, dirsearch)
- Step 6: Vulnerability scanning (nuclei, custom scripts)


#### 🌳 Storing & Managing Output:-
Don't let recon data go to waste:
- Store in .json, .csv, or SQLite
- Tag by date and target
- Use jq or Python to parse output later

Example:

        nuclei -json -l live.txt > nuclei_$(date +%F).json



#### 🌳 Recon at Scale: Wordlists, IP Ranges, Multiple Targets:- 
- Use amass, assetfinder, subfinder together
- Rotate through wordlists (SecLists, commonspeak)
- Use CIDR tools (naabu, masscan) on IP ranges


#### 🌳 Knowing When Not to Automate:- 
- Private programs often need manual finesse
- Automation won’t interpret business logic or subtle bugs
- Over-automation causes noisy, low-quality reports

Balance is key. Automate the boring. Focus your mind on the clever.
