### JavaScript Files and Endpoint Mining

#### 🌳 Why JS matters in Recon
Benefits of analyzing JS:
- Discover undocumented endpoints
- Understand app logic flow
- Identify vulnerable client-side code (ex- insecure JWT handling)
- Find secrets or tokens accidentally hardcoded


#### 🌳 Locating JavaScript Files:-
Start by:
- Opening Dev Tools (Network tab)
- Filtering by .js files.
- Crawling HTML to find <script> tags
- Using tools like linkfinder, subjs, or gospider
  
Also consider:
    JS files in /static/, /js/, /assets/, /build/


#### 🌳 Crawling and Collecting JS Files:-
Automate collection using:

        gau <domain> | grep "\.js$"
        waybackurls <domain> | grep "\.js$"
        subjs -i domains.txt


#### 🌳 Parsing for Endpoints:-

Use LinkFinder or JSParser to extract:
- API routes (/api/v1/users)
- Internal admin paths (/internal, /debug)
- Upload endpoints
- WebSocket connections

You can also grep manually:

    grep -oEi "['\"][a-zA-Z0-9_\/\-?&=]{5,}['\"]" app.js



#### 🌳 Look for Sensitive Keys and Secrets:- 
Sometimes developers hardcode:
- API keys
- Firebase credentials
- AWS secrets
- JWT tokens

Tools like SecretFinder and TruffleHog can scan JS content for known patterns.

Watch for:

    api_key =
    Authorization: Bearer ...
    const secret =



#### 🌳 Understand Logic Flows:-
Follow how the JS interacts with the backend:
- How is authentication handled?
- Are tokens stored in localStorage?
- Are there privilege flags exposed in frontend?
- Any logic branches based on user role?

Knowing this helps when chaining client-side info with backend bugs.


#### 🌳 Dynamic JS and Obfuscation:-
You may encounter:
- Minified JS: Use Prettier or JS beautifiers
- Obfuscated variables: Look for patterns and decode in browser
- Dynamically loaded JS via XHR or modules

Use browser breakpoints and search tools (like Ctrl+Shift+F) to trace logic.


#### 🌳 Focus on Third-Party and Vendor JS:- 
Third-party libraries may leak:
- Hidden routes exposed for debugging
- CSP weaknesses or unsafe eval usage
- Outdated scripts with known CVEs

Example: Admin dashboards like Kibana or Grafana loaded via exposed JS.


#### 🌳 Monitor for Changes Over Time:- 
JS changes frequently. Track them using:
- gau + diff comparison
- GitHub monitoring for frontend repos
- Web archives to analyze version drift
  
This helps spot newly added features or endpoints you missed earlier.


#### 🌳 Build Your JS Analysis Workflow:-
Suggested process:
- Trace logic in dev tools
- Enumerate all JS files (live + historical)
- Beautify and scan with LinkFinder, SecretFinder
- Manually grep for endpoints and sensitive values
- Probe discovered endpoints for misconfigurations
- Chain findings with IDOR, auth bypass, or CORS bugs



##### JS files are treasure maps. They may not show vulnerabilities directly, but they typically point to them.
