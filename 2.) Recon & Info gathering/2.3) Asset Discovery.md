# Asset Discovery: Identifying Attack Surface
- Subdomains represent just one piece of the overall picture. Asset discovery involves locating every publicly accessible service, domain, IP address, cloud resource, and API that could potentially be exploited. By doing this, subdomain enumeration is linked to tangible, testable targets, allowing you to clearly define what falls within scope and deserves attention.

- In essence, asset discovery is the process of charting a company’s digital boundary.


#### 🌳 Go Beyond Domains and Subdomains:-
- Public IPs not tied to DNS
- Forgotten cloud buckets (S3, GCP)
- APIs with undocumented endpoints
- External services used by internal teams

Real asset discovery finds what’s overlooked or misconfigured.


#### 🌳 Correlate Subdomains with IP Addresses:-

Once subdomains are resolved, correlate them with:

    Public IPs (via dig, dnsx, host)
    Reverse DNS lookups
    ASN mapping

Use:

    securitytrails.com
    shodan.io
    censys.io

This reveals shared hosting, cloud misconfigurations, and third-party integrations.


#### 🌳 Identify Wildcard or Catch-All Configurations:- 
Identify patterns like:

    randomtext.example.com resolves with 200 OK
    All unknown subdomains redirect to a generic page

It may indicate:

    CDN misconfigurations
    Default routing
    Legacy or wildcard deployments


#### 🌳 Use ASN and IP Range Mapping:-

Use Autonomous System Numbers (ASN) to map infrastructure:

    Identify owned IP ranges
    Find edge nodes, VPNs, or cloud regions

Tools:

    asnmap
    bgp.he.net
    ipinfo.io


#### 🌳 Cloud Asset Discovery:-

Modern companies rely heavily on cloud services. Look for:

    Amazon S3 buckets (check with tools like S3Scanner)
    GCP buckets (gsutil)
    Azure blob storage

Look for:

    Open permissions
    File listings
    Misconfigured ACLs

Cloud leaks are still a top bounty source.


#### 🌳 Leverage APIs for Asset Discovery

Bug bounty targets often expose APIs — REST, GraphQL, or gRPC.

Discover them via:

    Crawling JS files
    Monitoring Swagger/OpenAPI docs
    Mobile app reverse engineering


#### 🌳 Discover External Integrations and Third-Party Assets

External vendors or integrations can expand the attack surface. Look for:

    Payment gateways
    Analytics dashboards
    Email providers
    Internal tooling exposed externally



#### 🌳 Don’t Forget About IP-Based Targets

Some services are only accessible via IP address — no DNS record.

Use:

    masscan or nmap on resolved IPs
    Identify live HTTP, SSH, RDP, or FTP services
    Banner grabbing to detect internal apps exposed by mistake


#### 🌳 Build Asset Maps Visually

Maintain a mental or visual map of assets. Track relationships:

    Which subdomains point to the same app?
    What services are hosted on the same box?
    Are staging and production on the same cloud provider?

Tools:

    Mindmaps
    Recon dashboards
    Network graph visualizers


#### 🌳 Keep Your Asset Inventory Fresh

Attack surfaces change fast:

    CI/CD pipelines push updates
    Devs spin up new services weekly
    Subdomains shift infrastructure
