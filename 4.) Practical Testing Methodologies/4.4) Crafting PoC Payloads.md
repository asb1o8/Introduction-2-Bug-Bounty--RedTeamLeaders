## Crafting Proof of Concept (PoC) Payloads


#### 🌳 Why PoC Matters ?

In bug bounty hunting, a well-crafted Proof of Concept (PoC) is what separates a low-quality submission from a credible, high-paying report. It is your way of showing, not telling, that a vulnerability is real, reproducible, and exploitable. A strong PoC:

    Clearly demonstrates impact
    Is safe and non-destructive
    Follows the rules of engagement
    Requires minimal explanation to understand


#### 🌳 The Goal of a PoC:-

Your PoC should:

    Reproduce the bug reliably every time
    Simulate a realistic attack scenario
    Show how the bug could be abused in real-world conditions
    Communicate the impact to a technical reviewer without guesswork


#### 🌳 What Makes a Good PoC:- 

A strong PoC usually:

    Includes step-by-step instructions or a script
    Shows all relevant request/response data
    Demonstrates impact (e.g., sensitive data access, privilege escalation)
    Is clean and concise (not overly complex)
    Respects program scope and target environment


#### 🌳 Tailoring PoCs to Vulnerability Type:-
Vulnerability	PoC Style
XSS	Simple HTML page with payload embedded or Burp Repeater request
IDOR	Screenshot + Repeater request showing unauthorized access
SQLi	Reproducible POST/GET request with payload triggering SQL response or delay
CSRF	Crafted HTML page making an auto-submitting form
SSRF	URL input sending request to a controlled server (e.g., webhook.site)
Open Redirect	Link with parameter redirecting to a controlled domain


#### 🌳 Tools and Environments for Testing:-

    Burp Suite Repeater: Ideal for sending custom HTTP requests and capturing response diffs
    RequestBin / Hookbin / Interactsh: For observing SSRF, blind XSS, etc.
    Custom HTML files: To simulate CSRF, XSS, or browser-based issues
    Postman: For clean API PoCs
    Python/Bash scripts: For complex or automated workflows


#### 🌳 Keep It Safe and Controlled:-
Never:

    Trigger destructive actions like deleting resources
    Exploit production users or systems beyond your session
    Dump large databases or exfiltrate sensitive data unnecessarily

Instead:

    Show the possibility and vector, not actual damage
    Use your own account or controlled resources whenever possible

#### 🌳 Structure of a Strong PoC:-

Example structure:

Title: IDOR Allows Access to Other Users' Invoices
Steps:
1. Log in with test account A
2. Capture request to GET /invoices/12345
3. Change the ID to 12344
4. Receive another user’s invoice in the response
Impact: Disclosure of other users’ financial data

Or for a CSRF:

<form action="https://target.com/change-email" method="POST">
  <input type="hidden" name="email" value="attacker@evil.com">
  <input type="submit" value="Submit">
</form>
<script>document.forms[0].submit()</script>


#### 🌳 Use Your Own Payload Infrastructure When Needed:- 

For certain vulnerabilities:

    Use webhook.site or Burp Collaborator to confirm SSRF or blind XSS
    Host files or payloads on your own server (e.g., JS file for DOM XSS)

Maintain logs and include screenshots or timestamps for proof.


#### 🌳 Reporting with PoC Included:-

When submitting:

    Include all PoC data inline or in attachments
    Keep the format easy to follow (markdown, bullet points, numbered steps)
    Include screenshots or screen recordings when impact is visual
    Avoid over-explaining – let the evidence do the talking

#### 🌳 Red Team Mindset in PoCs:-

Think like a real attacker, but behave like a professional researcher. Your PoC is a simulation of exploitation, not exploitation itself. Highlight how a real adversary could act—and provide guidance on mitigating it.
Final Insight

A PoC is your voice in a bug bounty report. It’s your chance to prove value, show skill, and communicate risk. Strong PoCs lead to fast triage, higher bounties, and respect from triagers.
