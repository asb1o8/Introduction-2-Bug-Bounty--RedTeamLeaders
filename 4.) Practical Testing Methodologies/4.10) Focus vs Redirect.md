 ## When to Go Deep vs When to Pivot to Other Targets


#### 🌳 Strategic Time Management in Bug Hunting:-
- Bug bounty hunters often waste time on unproductive targets. Knowing when to dig deep versus pivoting to another
  asset can be the difference between lost hours and a critical bounty.
  
 
 #### 🌳 When to Go Deep:- 
You should consider only when target:
- The program is well-scoped and offers multiple allowed endpoints or subdomains
- You’ve found uncommon technologies or patterns (e.g., custom APIs, legacy systems, GraphQL, WAFs with bypass potential)
- The target has predictable structures or custom business logic
- You detect partial vulnerabilities or misconfigurations worth exploring (e.g., reflected input without output encoding)
- You've had recent signal or low competition (e.g., few reports, fresh program)
- The asset is under-tested (e.g., beta services, dev domains, obscure mobile endpoints)

Going deep requires patience, creativity, and a good methodology. This is where manual testing shines.


#### 🌳 When to Pivot:- 
Know when to move on:
- No signal after several hours of solid recon and testing
- You find heavily tested, hardened targets with patched vulnerabilities
- The application is large and undocumented, but scope is restricted
- You’re limited by lack of credentials, hard authentication, or black-box testing
- A target is filled with false positives, rate-limiting, or heavy obfuscation
- You're no longer learning or producing new angles

Don’t confuse frustration with persistence. Pivoting to another domain or subdomain in scope might instantly surface easier wins.


#### 🌳 Signal-Driven Targeting:- 
Advanced hunters track “signal” — signs that a target may produce results. Examples:
- Leaked JavaScript files containing hardcoded endpoints
- Exposed API documentation
- URLs from Wayback that are no longer linked but still live
- Error messages or stack traces
- GitHub repos mentioning internal tools or parameters

Signal is often subtle. Follow breadcrumbs.


#### 🌳 Build a Recon Graph:- 
Create a mental or visual map of your recon process per asset:
- Subdomains → live hosts → tech stack → endpoints → params → issues
- When a path ends in too many 403s, 401s, or dead links, move laterally

Pivot means not abandoning the program, but shifting focus intelligently across the attack surface.


#### 🌳 Think in Layers:-
Depth can mean:
- Testing authenticated vs unauthenticated
- Shifting from web to mobile or API testing
- Moving from public-facing to internal-accessible endpoints (via SSRF, CORS, misconfigs)
- Chaining two low-severity findings into something impactful

Layers exist in every app — horizontal (user to user) and vertical (user to admin) privilege testing is often overlooked.


#### 🌳 Use Metrics:-
- If after 2–3 hours you haven’t discovered any input, parameters, or vulnerable behavior, it’s a good moment to pause
- Conversely, even one interesting response (error, stack trace, redirect) can justify another hour of digging


#### 🌳 Trust Your Instincts, But Log Your Reasoning:-

Always note why you’re leaving or staying on a target. This helps avoid emotional decisions and builds a history of strategic recon.

Example:

    Pivoted from shop.target.com after 2 hours: only static content, all input sanitized, no parameters exposed. No promising JS files.


#### 🌳 Balance is a Skill:-

Going too wide makes you shallow. Going too deep burns time. Elite hunters master the balance. This only comes through experience and reflection.


#### 🌳 Final Advice:-
- Use a structured recon flow (Subdomain → HTTP probe → Tech ID → Content Discovery → JS Analysis → Vuln Testing)
- Follow signal. Go deep where breadcrumbs exist.
- Don’t chase ghosts. If it’s dry, pivot.
- Measure your time. Respect it.
- Quality over quantity always wins in bug bounty.
