## Tools Stack: gau, waybackurls, ffuf, nuclei, httpx, subfinder


#### 🌳 gau (GetAllUrls):-
- What it does: Fetches known URLs of a domain from sources like Wayback Machine, Common Crawl, AlienVault's OTX,
                URLScan, etc.
- Why it's useful:
        Reveals legacy paths, hidden endpoints, deleted resources that may still be accessible.
        Useful for testing parameters on outdated APIs.
    Example:

       echo "target.com" | gau > all_urls.txt  


#### 🌳 Waybackurls:-
- What it does: Similar to gau, but focuses on extracting URLs from the Internet Archive’s Wayback Machine.
- Why it's useful: Easy to pipe into tools like gf or qsreplace for pattern-based testing. Example:

      echo "target.com" | waybackurls > legacy.txt  

Tip: Combine gau and waybackurls, then deduplicate:

    cat gau.txt waybackurls.txt | sort -u > merged_urls.txt


#### 🌳 ffuf (Fuzz Faster U Fool):- 
- What it does: A fast web fuzzer for directory brute-force, parameter discovery, and more.
- Why it's useful:

      Bruteforces directories or filenames using custom wordlists
      Supports GET and POST requests
      Can be used for VHOST fuzzing and recursive discovery
  
    Example:

      ffuf -u https://target.com/FUZZ -w /path/to/wordlist.txt -mc all  

    Advanced:

      ffuf -w wordlist.txt -u https://target.com/page.php?file=FUZZ  

#### 🌳 Nuclei:-
- What it does: Vulnerability scanner using YAML-based templates.
- Why it's useful:

      Detects known CVEs, misconfigurations, and exposure with speed and precision
      Highly customizable

Example:

    nuclei -u https://target.com -t vulnerabilities/  

- Best used with updated template repo:

       nuclei -update-templates

- Filter by severity:

      nuclei -l urls.txt -severity high,critical  

 
#### 🌳 HTTPX:-
- What it does: Probes a list of URLs and gathers metadata (status code, title, technologies, redirects, etc.)
- Why it's useful:

      Quickly filters out live hosts
      Helps identify interesting responses

Example:

      cat subdomains.txt | httpx -status-code -title -tech-detect  

You can use it with `-sc`, `-follow-redirects`, or `-web-server `for extra detail.


#### 🌳 Subfinder:-
- What it does: Finds subdomains using passive sources (Shodan, CertSpotter, AlienVault, etc.)
- Why it's useful:

       Core of passive recon and surface expansion
       Easily automated in scripts

Example:

    subfinder -d target.com -o subdomains.txt  

Tip: Combine with `httpx` to check which subdomains are live:

     subfinder -d target.com | httpx -silent


#### 🌳 Integration & Automation:-
A sample automated recon chain:

    subfinder -d target.com | tee subs.txt | httpx -silent | tee live.txt | gau | tee urls.txt | nuclei -l live.txt -severity high

You can create bash functions or alias each tool for faster usage.


#### 🌳 Wordlists and Templates:-
- Use SecLists for ffuf and nuclei
- Always keep nuclei-templates updated
- Customize based on target tech stack

Example wordlists:
- `directory-list-2.3-medium.txt`
- `raft-large-directories.txt`
- `params.txt` for GET/POST fuzzing


#### 🌳 Final Insight:-
Each tool has its strength:
- subfinder= to expand surface
- httpx= to validate and filter
- gau/waybackurls= to find forgotten paths
- ffuf= to brute-force access
- nuclei= to catch low-hanging CVEs

A professional uses them in combination, chained by context—not just volume. Know when and why to run each tool.
