## Multi-step Logic Chains and Abuse Cases


#### 🌳 What Are Multi-Step Logic Chains?
Multi-step logic chains are vulnerability paths that emerge from chaining multiple legitimate behaviors in a 
way that violates business logic or security assumptions. Each individual step may seem harmless, but the 
combination leads to serious abuse or exploitation.


#### 🌳 Why They Matter in Bug Bounty ?
These bugs are:
- Rarely detectable by scanners
- Frequently overlooked in normal testing
- Highly rewarded due to creativity, abuse potential, and business impact
- Often reflect real-world attacker thinking

Examples include:
- Bypassing payment flows
- Accessing restricted features for free
- Skipping approval workflows

#### 🌳 Real-World Examples:- 
- Example 1: Free Subscription Abuse

      Start free trial
      Cancel immediately (to avoid billing)
      Switch to premium plan before trial ends
      Get premium benefits indefinitely

- Example 2: Account Takeover via Workflow Abuse

      Request password reset
      Intercept or guess reset token
      Change email first
      Then reset password

These are not necessarily technical bugs—they reflect broken logic.


#### 🌳 Techniques for Discovering Logic Chains:-
- Map entire workflows (registration, checkout, upgrade)
- Track state transitions (logged in vs out, verified vs unverified)
- Abuse timing (race conditions, delay windows)
- Test multi-user interactions (invites, sharing, permissions)
- Think abnormally: What happens if I skip step 3? Or reuse token from step 1?


#### 🌳 Good Targets for Logic Chains:-
- Financial systems (billing, discounts, gift cards)
- SaaS platforms with roles and permissions
- Ticketing systems (cancellation, rebooking)
- API flows where token scopes or roles are assumed but not enforced
- Multi-tenant environments (data segregation)


#### 🌳 Required Mindset:-
- Understand the business: You must know what’s “supposed” to happen
- Think like an abuser, not just a hacker
- Study how normal users interact with the application
- Try unusual orders, skipped steps, replays, and token reuse

These bugs aren’t about payloads—they’re about insight.


#### 🌳 Tools That Help:-
- Burp Suite Repeater + Logger++ for replaying sequences
- Postman or Insomnia for clear API flow management
- Custom scripts to automate complex workflows or simulate real usage
- Proxy + session recorders for reviewing entire journeys


#### 🌳 Mistakes to Avoid:-
- Treating each request in isolation
- Assuming business logic is enforced on backend
- Overreliance on static analysis or wordlists
- Ignoring application flows that look “too obvious”

Logic bugs hide in plain sight. The more “normal” the functionality, the more likely it’s been overlooked.


#### 🌳 Reporting Multi-Step Chains:-
In your report:
- Lay out each step clearly
- Show the normal behavior vs the abused one
- Highlight the impact: what a malicious actor could achieve
- Provide screenshots or logs for each request

Clarity is critical—your report should feel like a narrative walkthrough.


#### 🌳 Final Insight:-
Logic abuse isn’t about finding a single broken thing. It’s about understanding how things connect and using 
that knowledge to violate trust boundaries. The best bug hunters simulate adversarial use cases, not just 
technical errors.
