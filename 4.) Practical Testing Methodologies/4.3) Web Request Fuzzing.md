## Fuzzing for Parameters, Headers and Query Strings


#### 🌳 What is Fuzzing?
- Fuzzing is the process of systematically injecting payloads into different parts of a request—such as
  parameters, headers, and query strings—to observe unexpected behavior, crashes, or security flaws.
  In bug bounty hunting, it’s a vital technique to discover vulnerabilities that are missed by traditional scans.


#### 🌳 Goals of Fuzzing in Bug Bounty:- 
- Discover hidden or undocumented parameters
- Trigger application errors to uncover logic flaws or misconfigurations
- Bypass access controls or WAFs
- Identify unsanitized user input (leading to XSS, SQLi, SSRF, etc.)
- Observe behavioral differences that may signal broken logic


#### 🌳 Fuzzable Targets:- 
- Common fuzzing targets include:

      GET and POST parameters
      HTTP headers (User-Agent, Referer, Host, X-Forwarded-For, Origin, etc.)
      Query strings and URL paths
      Cookies
      JSON/XML body payloads
      Multipart/form-data boundaries


#### 🌳 Useful Payloads for Different Cases:- 
- Payloads vary by goal. Examples:

        XSS: <script>, "><img src=x onerror=alert(1)>
       SQLi: ' OR 1=1--, UNION SELECT NULL
      SSRF: http://127.0.0.1:80, http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/
      LFI: ../../../../etc/passwd, %2e%2e/
      Header injection: \nSet-Cookie: admin=true

Use well-known payloads from SecLists, PayloadAllTheThings, or craft custom ones.


#### 🌳 Tools for Fuzzing:- 
- Burp Suite Intruder – Powerful, but limited in the community version
- ffuf – Fast and versatile fuzzing tool for parameters and directories
- wfuzz – Flexible, supports complex workflows and token fuzzing
- Turbo Intruder – Fast fuzzing with scripting capability (for advanced users)
- qsreplace – Useful to automate query parameter fuzzing in recon pipelines


#### 🌳 Fuzzing Techniques for Parameters:-
- Parameter name fuzzing: Find hidden or undocumented parameters (e.g., debug, admin, user_id, next)
- Parameter value fuzzing: Inject malicious or malformed data into known parameters
- Recursive fuzzing: Use response data to inform next payloads (token chaining)

Combine parameter discovery with reflection to spot XSS or logic flaws.


#### 🌳 Header Fuzzing: Often Overlooked:-
- Spoofing headers like X-Forwarded-For, X-Original-URL, or X-Host can lead to bypasses
- Some apps use headers for authentication or origin verification
- Headers can trigger SSRF, path traversal, or routing flaws

Example:

    X-Forwarded-Host: internal.service
    X-Original-URL: /admin


#### 🌳 Detecting Anomalies and Responses:- 
Focus on:
- Status codes: Look for deviations (403 → 200, 500, etc.)
- Response length: Large differences may indicate reflected input or logic
- Timing differences: May point to time-based SQLi or blind SSRF
- Reflected input: Useful for XSS or HTML injection

Compare behavior with a control payload (e.g., test123) to spot changes.


#### 🌳 Bypassing WAFs and Filters:- 
Use fuzzing to try evasion techniques:
- WAF bypass encoding: %27 vs ', %00 null bytes
- Parameter pollution: ?id=1&id=2
- Header smuggling: Multiple Host headers
- Case or format manipulation: uSeR_id, USER[ID]

Don’t assume the first payload is the one that works. Try variations.


#### 🌳 Practical Tips and Workflow:-
- Start with known parameters and work outward
- Monitor logs and response behavior carefully
- Combine with context: if the app uses JSON, fuzz JSON fields; for GraphQL, fuzz queries
- Save fuzzing results and map patterns of what works across apps
- Respect rate limits, and avoid unnecessary noise on targets


#### 🌳 Final Insight:- 
Fuzzing is not just about spraying payloads. It’s about observation, hypothesis, and controlled experimentation. 
Successful hunters know how to read the application’s behavior and adapt fuzzing based on subtle clues.
