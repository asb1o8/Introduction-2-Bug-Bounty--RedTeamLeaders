## 3.10 Application Logic Errors and Broken Business Processes


#### 🌳 What Are Logic Flaws ?
- Application logic errors occur when developers design a system that technically works as intended but can be 
abused due to flawed assumptions about user behavior, input, or workflow. These are not always caused by 
misconfigurations or missing sanitization — they’re errors in how the app thinks.


#### 🌳 Why They’re Hard to Find ?

Logic flaws:
- Are not detected by scanners
- Often require deep knowledge of the application's functionality
- Vary significantly between different applications
- Demand creativity, patience, and domain understanding

Unlike XSS or SQLi, there is no universal payload. You need to study the business logic and look for abuse scenarios.


#### 🌳 Examples of Logic Flaws:- 
- Race Conditions: Performing the same action in parallel results in unauthorized access or money transfer
- Broken Price Validation: Manipulating product prices in client-side data and bypassing backend checks
- Account Takeovers via Password Reset Flows: Predictable tokens, missing verification steps, or misuse of user identifiers
- Coupon Abuse: Reusing or stacking promo codes
- Authentication Bypass via Logic Abuse: Skipping steps, guessing tokens, or reusing sessions
- Improper Workflow Checks: User is allowed to perform admin actions via broken role validation


#### 🌳 Real-World Scenarios:- 
- Booking Manipulation: Booking multiple rooms or flights for free by abusing how availability is calculated
- Points/Funds Manipulation: Redeeming the same loyalty points multiple times due to missing transaction locking
- Business Process Bypass: Finalizing purchases without completing full payment flow


#### 🌳 How to Discover Logic Issues:-
- Think Like a Malicious User: “What would I do if I had no morals and access to this app?”
- Map the Workflow: Visualize the steps required to complete actions, then test each step in isolation
- Test State Transitions: Can steps be repeated, skipped, or performed in a different order?
- Fuzz Identifiers: Test how the system handles user IDs, order numbers, tokens, etc.
Ask:
- Can I trick the system into doing something it shouldn’t?
- Is it making assumptions that I can violate?
- Is the server verifying or blindly trusting client-side state?


#### 🌳 Tools and Techniques:- 
Logic bugs are mostly manual:
- Burp Suite (Repeater, Intruder): Replay requests with altered flow
- Race condition tools: race-the-web, Turbo Intruder
- Logging and Recording: Use plugins to capture complete user actions and replicate the workflow


#### 🌳 Bug Bounty Report Tips:- 
When reporting logic issues:
- Carefully explain the business context and impact
- Include step-by-step reproduction
- Demonstrate how it can be abused at scale
- Emphasize financial, privacy, or authorization impact

Example:
- ###### "By replaying step 3 of the checkout without completing step 2, I was able to purchase the product without being charged."

#### 🌳 Logic vs Exploit:-

Logic bugs often:
- Have no visible errors
- Do not crash the app
- Don’t trigger security alerts

That’s why they’re prized in bug bounty — many go unnoticed by security teams until reported.


#### 🌳 Not Always Technical:-
Some of the best logic bugs are found by understanding:
- Business workflows
- Compliance and policy assumptions
- How real users interact with the platform

You don’t need advanced tooling — you need critical thinking and creativity.


#### 🌳 Common Categories to Focus on:- 
- Authentication flows
- Payment and subscription logic
- User roles and permissions
- Resource creation/deletion (race conditions)
- Rate limits and abuse controls
- Redemption/reward systems
- Workflow transitions and edge cases

#### 🌳 Conclusion:-
- Logic flaws require you to think outside the box. They reward observation, creativity, and an attacker’s
  mindset. Learn how apps behave — not just how they’re built — and you’ll find vulnerabilities no scanner ever
  will.
