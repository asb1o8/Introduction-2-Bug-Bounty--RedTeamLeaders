 ## Subdomain Takeover: From DNS Misconfigs to Cloud Misuse
 
 
 #### 🌳 What is Subdomain Takeover?

Subdomain takeover occurs when a subdomain (something.target.com) points to an external service (e.g., GitHub Pages, Heroku, AWS S3), but the resource it references is no longer in use — meaning the attacker can register or claim it, effectively gaining control over the subdomain.

It’s a DNS-level misconfiguration where the CNAME exists, but the resource is unclaimed or removed.
