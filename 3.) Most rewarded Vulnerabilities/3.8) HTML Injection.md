## HTML Injection and UI Redressing (Clickjacking)
`Origin`

- HTML Injection happens when user-controlled input is embedded directly into the HTML structure of a webpage without proper sanitization. Unlike XSS, which typically involves JavaScript execution, HTML Injection focuses on altering the visible layout or structure of the page — including forms, buttons, links, and elements like `<iframe>`, `<img>`, and `<div>`.


#### 🌳 Why HTML Injection Matters
Though not always leading to full JS execution, HTML Injection can still cause:
- Content spoofing or defacement
- Fake login forms for phishing
- Visual trickery to influence user actions
- Forced redirections or behavioral manipulation
- Client-side attacks if combined with browser quirks or misconfigurations
