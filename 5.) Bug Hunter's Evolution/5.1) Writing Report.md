## How to Write a High-Impact Vulnerability Report


#### 🌳 Introduction:-
- A strong vulnerability report is not just a technical write-up; it's a persuasive communication tool. Your report must clearly show the bug, prove the risk, and communicate effectively with security analysts and developers who may not be hackers. Weak reports often get ignored, delayed, or rejected. High-impact ones get rewarded quickly and build your reputation.


#### 🌳 Know Your Audience:-
You are writing for:
- Security analysts who triage hundreds of reports
- Developers who need to fix your finding
- Program managers who assess business risk

Keep it concise, clear, and focused on what matters most: reproducibility and impact.


#### 🌳 Recommended Report Structure:- 

Use a logical, predictable structure:

    Title – Brief and specific
    Summary – High-level description and impact
    Steps to Reproduce – Clear, numbered steps
    Impact – What could an attacker do?
    Supporting Material – Screenshots, payloads, scripts
    Recommendation – Optional, but appreciated
    Timeline – Optional, for responsible disclosure



#### 🌳 Write a Strong Summary:- 
The summary is what reviewers read first. It should:
- State the vulnerability class
- Describe the affected endpoint or feature
- Explain the attacker's gain (e.g., “...leads to account takeover”)

Example:
- An IDOR in /api/user/settings allows an attacker to change email addresses of other users, leading to potential account takeover.

Avoid vague summaries like “there’s a bug in the user system.”


#### 🌳 Use Reproducible, Numbered Steps:- 
- Number every action precisely. Assume the reader will copy-paste your steps into a terminal or browser.

Bad:

    Just intercept the request and change the ID.

Better:
1. Login as User A at https://app.example.com/login
2. Go to Profile → Settings
3. Intercept the POST request to /api/user/settings
4. Replace `user_id` with another valid user ID
5. Send the modified request. The target user’s email is changed.


#### 🌳 Emphasize Impact Clearly

Avoid hype. Focus on what the attacker gains, and why it matters to the business.

Bad:

    This could be really bad if combined with other attacks.

Good:

    An attacker can reset email addresses of other users, which may lead to full account takeover if MFA is not enforced.

If it needs credentials, explain why that doesn’t reduce risk. Clarify the threat model.


#### 🌳 Avoid Overwriting Logs:-
- Avoid overly long technical dumps. Don’t paste entire JS files or HTML responses. Focus on the part that matters. Use code blocks, and highlight payloads and key values.



#### 🌳 Use the Right Language and Tone:-
- Be professional. No memes, slang, or jokes.
- Avoid adversarial tone. You're collaborating, not attacking.
- Be concise. Remove filler sentences.
- Use short paragraphs and clear headers.


#### 🌳 Attachments Matter:- 
- Screenshots and videos help triagers understand fast
- Use tools like Burp’s Logger, Replay, or Postman collections
- Redact sensitive info
- Use proper file names like step3-modified-request.txt or PoC.mp4



#### 🌳 Final Checklist:- 
- Clear, specific title?
- High-level summary included?
- Steps are numbered and reproducible?
- Payloads and affected parameters included?
- Impact is clearly explained?
- Optional PoC files/screens/videos attached?
