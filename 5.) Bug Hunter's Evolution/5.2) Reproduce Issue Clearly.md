## Reproducing the Issue Clearly and Step-by-Step
1. Reproducibility is King

A vulnerability report is only as strong as its reproducibility. If the triage analyst cannot replicate the issue exactly as you describe, your report may be rejected, marked as informational, or sit unresolved for months.

Your steps should allow someone with no prior context, limited time, and minimal technical background to follow your process click by click.
2. Assume Nothing

Don't assume the reviewer knows:

    Which account type you used (admin, guest, etc.)
    Which browser or extension matters
    If you’re using special headers, scripts, or cookies

Make everything explicit.
3. Use Numbered, Sequential Steps

Write your steps like a test case. Numbered. Clear. Deterministic.

Example:

1. Go to https://app.example.com and log in as a regular user
2. Click on “My Account” in the top right
3. Intercept the request to /api/user/profile using Burp Suite
4. Change the `user_id` parameter to another valid user (e.g., 103)
5. Forward the request
6. You will now see the other user's profile details in the response

Each action must lead logically to the next.
4. Don’t Mix Steps with Explanations

Separate how to reproduce from why it matters. Your goal in this section is functional replication, not justification.

Avoid:

    Then, because the IDOR isn’t properly secured, you can see the other profile.

Instead:

    You will receive the JSON response for the other user, including name, email, and internal notes.

5. Start with Environment Setup

If the bug depends on a specific configuration, state it:

    Which browser you used (if browser-related)
    Whether JavaScript must be enabled
    If credentials are required, how to get them
    Whether mobile or desktop matters

Example:

    Tested using Chrome 124.0.6367.98, logged in as a free-tier user.

6. Explain Dependencies and Context

If your PoC needs a JWT token, API key, CSRF token, or cookie manipulation, provide clear instructions on how to extract and use them.

Also helpful:

    Default credentials for test accounts
    How to access debug routes if available
    Explanation of authentication flows

7. Be Precise with Payloads

Use code blocks:

POST /api/email/change HTTP/1.1
Host: app.example.com
Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6...
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "new_email": "attacker@example.com",
  "user_id": "103"
}

And explicitly mark what values to change.
8. Provide Expected vs Actual Behavior

After reproduction steps, state:

    Expected behavior (according to security design)
    Actual behavior (what really happened)

Example:

    Expected: API rejects access to user_id 103
    Actual: API accepts change and returns 200 OK, with changes applied

9. Use Screenshots or Video Wisely

Only when they add clarity, not to replace steps:

    Use arrows or highlights
    Keep video under 2 minutes
    Don’t zoom or move too quickly
    Avoid voice narration; text is better for triage

10. Consider Edge Cases and Variants

If the bug works under multiple conditions, mention them:

    “Also works when sending GET instead of POST”
    “Also exploitable using X-Original-URL header”

This shows depth, boosts bounty value, and reduces follow-up.

Summary:
Your report's strength hinges on how easily someone else can see what you saw, do what you did, and understand why it matters. If a junior triager at 4

AM on a Monday can follow your steps and get the same result, you've written a winning reproduction section.
