## Reproducing the Issue Clearly and Step-by-Step


#### 🌳 Reproducibility is King:-
- A vulnerability report is only as strong as its reproducibility. If the triage analyst cannot replicate the issue exactly as you describe, your report may be rejected, marked as informational, or sit unresolved for months.
- Your steps should allow someone with no prior context, limited time, and minimal technical background to follow your process click by click.


#### 🌳 Assume Nothing:-
Don't assume the reviewer knows:
- Which account type you used (admin, guest, etc.)
- Which browser or extension matters
- If you’re using special headers, scripts, or cookies

Make everything explicit.


#### 🌳 Use Numbered, Sequential Steps:- 
Write your steps like a test case. Numbered. Clear. Deterministic.
Example:

1. Go to https://app.example.com and log in as a regular user
2. Click on “My Account” in the top right
3. Intercept the request to /api/user/profile using Burp Suite
4. Change the `user_id` parameter to another valid user (e.g., 103)
5. Forward the request
6. You will now see the other user's profile details in the response

Each action must lead logically to the next.


#### 🌳 Don’t Mix Steps with Explanations:-
Separate how to reproduce from why it matters. Your goal in this section is functional replication, not justification.

Avoid:

    Then, because the IDOR isn’t properly secured, you can see the other profile.

Instead:

    You will receive the JSON response for the other user, including name, email, and internal notes.


#### 🌳 Start with Environment Setup:-
If the bug depends on a specific configuration, state it:
- Which browser you used (if browser-related)
- Whether JavaScript must be enabled
- If credentials are required, how to get them
- Whether mobile or desktop matters

Example:

    Tested using Chrome 124.0.6367.98, logged in as a free-tier user.


#### 🌳 Explain Dependencies and Context:-
If your PoC needs a JWT token, API key, CSRF token, or cookie manipulation, provide clear instructions on how to extract and use them. Also helpful:
- Default credentials for test accounts
- How to access debug routes if available
- Explanation of authentication flows


#### 🌳 Be Precise with Payloads:-
Use code blocks:

```http
POST /api/email/change HTTP/1.1
Host: app.example.com
Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6...
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "new_email": "attacker@example.com",
  "user_id": "103"
}

```

And explicitly mark what values to change.


#### 🌳 Provide Expected vs Actual Behavior:-
After reproduction steps, state:
- Expected behavior (according to security design)
- Actual behavior (what really happened)

Example:

    Expected: API rejects access to user_id 103
    Actual: API accepts change and returns 200 OK, with changes applied


#### 🌳 Use Screenshots or Video Wisely:-
Only when they add clarity, not to replace steps:
- Use arrows or highlights
- Keep video under 2 minutes
- Don’t zoom or move too quickly
- Avoid voice narration; text is better for triage


#### 🌳 Consider Edge Cases and Variants:-
If the bug works under multiple conditions, mention them:
- Also works when sending `GET` instead of `POST`
- Also exploitable using `X-Original-URL` header

This shows depth, boosts bounty value, and reduces follow-up.


#### 🌳 Summary:
Your report's strength hinges on how easily someone else can see what you saw, do what you did, and understand why it matters.
