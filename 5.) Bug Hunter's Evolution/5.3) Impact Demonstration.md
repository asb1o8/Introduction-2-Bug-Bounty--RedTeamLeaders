## Demonstrating Impact Without Overstating



#### 🌳 Let the Impact Speak for Itself:-
> Security reports that exaggerate severity are often dismissed or downplayed. A good bug hunter respects the 
  reader's intelligence. If your finding is real and relevant, the impact will emerge from the facts, not from 
  loaded language.
Avoid terms like:
- “This can destroy the whole system”
- “Critical vulnerability with total takeover potential”
- Unless it’s actually a RCE, such language only undermines your credibility.


#### 🌳 Align with the Program’s Severity Model:-
Familiarize yourself with:
- Their definitions of Low / Medium / High /
- Past rewarded vulnerabilities and rationale

Show you understand how they score impact internally.

Example:

    According to the VRT, this IDOR exposing PII (name, email, user ID) qualifies as a High severity issue under “Sensitive Data Exposure”.



#### 🌳 Focus on Data Exposure, Privilege Escalation, or Functional Abuse:-
Ask yourself:
- What kind of data is exposed or manipulated?
- What level of user can trigger this bug?
- Can this be chained with something else?
- Does it bypass a protection mechanism (auth, CSRF, CORS, etc)?

Examples:
- “An unauthenticated attacker can enumerate emails of all users”
- “A normal user can access admin-only endpoints”


#### 🌳 Use Real, Redacted Examples:-
Instead of saying:
- “You can view sensitive data”

Say= Using a normal user account, I accessed this endpoint:
     
       /api/admin/users/1042
    
It returned:

    {
        "id": 1042,
        "name": "John Doe",
        "email": "john@example.com",
         "is_admin": true
    }

Then explain the business risk:
- This exposes administrator-level user information to any authenticated user.


#### 🌳 Reference Real-World Incidents (Cautiously):-
> If a similar vulnerability led to a known breach (like SSRF to metadata → AWS key exfiltration), mention it
briefly, but avoid hype.

Example:
- This SSRF allows access to internal metadata services on 169.254.169.254, similar to what occurred in the
  Capital One breach.

Use this only when relevant.


#### 🌳 Consider the Business Context:-
Not all XSS or IDORs are created equal. Ask:
- Is this internal or public-facing?
- Does this affect enterprise clients?
- Can this lead to monetary loss, brand damage, or legal issues?

Even a low-severity technical issue may become high impact with proper framing.



#### 🌳 Let Impact Drive Severity, Not the Technique:-
> Using a “hot” technique (like prototype pollution or cache poisoning) doesn’t mean the issue is critical.
The real-world effect matters more than the novelty of the vector.

Stick to:
- “This vulnerability allows X to do Y, which leads to Z outcome”



#### 🌳 Describe Exploitation Feasibility, Not Just Possibility:-
Be honest about the conditions needed:
- Is user interaction required?
- Is timing or race condition involved?
- Is the vulnerable feature rarely used?

Transparency builds trust and leads to better payouts.


#### 🌳 Avoid Words Like “Critical” Unless Backed by Proof:-
Instead of saying:
- “This is a critical issue”

Say:
- “This allows an attacker to elevate privileges from guest to admin and view sensitive user data, which I believe qualifies as a high to critical issue under your severity guidelines.”



#### 🌳 Close With a One-Line Summary of Impact:-
Use a final sentence like:
- In summary, this vulnerability allows an attacker to access other users' full profiles—including email, name,
  and role—without authorization.

This helps triage teams process reports faster.


#### 🌳 Summary:-
Impact is not about loud language—it's about measurable consequence. Clear reproduction + honest context = trust, 
and trust is what gets you accepted reports and higher bounties.
