## When to Include Screenshots, Videos and Scripts

- Visual and supplemental materials can significantly enhance the clarity and credibility of your bug report —
  when used wisely. However, overusing them or using them incorrectly can cause confusion or even hinder triage.
  Below are guidelines to know when, how, and what to include when submitting screenshots, videos, or scripts.


### 🌳 Include When Text Alone Isn't Enough:-
- If the issue involves multiple steps, complex interactions, or time-based behavior, screenshots and videos
  can save triagers time and demonstrate exactly what you saw.

- Use case:

  - Multi-step logic flows
  - DOM-based or visual issues (e.g., clickjacking)
  - Race conditions
  - CSRF exploits requiring user interaction
  - DOM XSS triggered only under specific client-side behavior


### 🌳 Screenshots: When and How to use them:- 
- Use When:

  - There’s a visual change (e.g., admin panel accessible, XSS pop-up, different UI element, error message).
  - Response payloads are long or formatted HTML/JSON.
  - You want to compare before/after states.

- Tips:

  - Crop the image to only the relevant area.
  - Blur any sensitive personal data (PII).
  - Use annotations (arrows, boxes) only if they improve clarity.
  - Do not send dozens of screenshots — one or two well-labeled ones are enough.


### 🌳 Videos: When and How to use them:- 
- Use When:

  - The bug is complex or requires user interaction.
  - The bug is time-sensitive (e.g., race condition).
  - The steps are hard to explain in static images or text.

- Tips:

    - Use a lightweight screen recording tool (e.g., OBS, ShareX, Loom).
    - Keep videos short (under 2 minutes ideally).
    - Narration is optional but should be concise if included.
    - Name your video file meaningfully (e.g., SSRF-demo.mp4).

### 🌳 Scripts and Automation:- 
- Use When:

    - The exploit requires a custom script (e.g., SSRF payloads, automation of IDOR).
    -  You want to ensure reproducibility with minimal effort.
    - The endpoint is protected with tokens or custom headers.

- Tips:

    - Clean up your code and add basic comments.
    - Include expected usage: “Run this with Python 3.9, requires requests.”
    - Avoid hardcoding credentials or sensitive data.


### 🌳 When Not to Include Visuals:-
- For trivial bugs where one clear sentence is sufficient.
- To pad the report unnecessarily.
- When screenshots add no value to understanding the bug.

Example:

> Reporting a missing HttpOnly flag on a cookie doesn’t need a screenshot. A copy of the Set-Cookie header is
enough.


### 🌳 Consistency and Labeling:-
- Label all attachments clearly:

    - xss_triggered.mp4
    - admin_panel_access.png
    - csrf_poc.html

Avoid vague names like screen1.png or test.mov.


### 🌳 Include Both Text and Visuals:-
- Never rely only on visuals. Always provide full reproduction steps in text, and use screenshots/videos/scripts
  as supplements — not replacements.

  
### 🌳 Security and Privacy in Media:-
- Always:

    - Blur usernames, IPs, emails, tokens.
    - Remove any data not relevant to the report.
    - Avoid exposing third-party unrelated vulnerabilities or data.


### 🌳 Compress Before Uploading:-
- Reduce video/image size to avoid slow uploads or download issues by triage teams. Tools like Handbrake
  (for video) and TinyPNG (for images) are useful.

  
### 🌳 Linking and Hosting:-
- If your platform allows attachments, use them. If not:

    - Use trusted services like Google Drive (with permission set correctly), GitHub Gists, or Streamable.
    - Avoid shady or temporary file hosts.

### 🌳 Summary:
- Visuals and scripts can elevate your report from “valid” to “excellent” — when used thoughtfully. Make sure
  they are purposeful, clean, properly labeled, and supplement your written report rather than replace it.
