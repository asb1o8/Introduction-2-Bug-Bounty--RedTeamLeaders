## Common Report Mistakes and How to Avoid Them

- A good vulnerability report should be clear, reproducible, and demonstrate real-world impact. However, many
  bug bounty hunters — especially beginners — fall into traps that reduce the effectiveness and credibility
  of their submissions. Below are the most frequent mistakes seen in real-world programs and how to avoid them.


### 🌳 Lack of Reproducibility:-
Mistake:
> Submitting a vague or incomplete Proof of Concept (PoC) without the steps to replicate.

Fix:
> Always include a step-by-step walkthrough, with exact requests, screenshots, and expected vs actual behavior.
Use cURL or Burp Suite logs to show what you sent and what was returned.


### 🌳 Overstating Impact:-
Mistake:
> Claiming “account takeover” or “RCE” when the actual bug is a minor misconfiguration.

Fix:
> Be honest and factual. If the impact is unclear, state what could happen, but use tentative language like
“may lead to…” or “could potentially result in…”


### 🌳 Underexplaining Technical Details:-
Mistake:
> Writing “XSS in comment field” with no explanation or context.

Fix:
> Explain how the payload works, why it was not filtered, and what the consequences are. Describe whether the
XSS is reflected, stored, or DOM-based, and include browser behavior if relevant.


### 🌳 Missing Scope Awareness:-

Mistake:
> Reporting vulnerabilities in assets or domains that are out of scope for the program.

Fix:
> Double-check the scope of the program. If you find something on an adjacent asset, ask the program if it’s 
eligible before submitting — especially in private programs.


### 🌳 Skipping the “Expected Behavior” Section:-

Mistake:
> Describing what happened, but not what should have happened.

Fix:
> Always include a clear comparison:

    Expected result: Users cannot access other users' invoices.
    Actual result: Any authenticated user can access /invoices/[id].


### 🌳 Inconsistent Terminology

Mistake:
> Using the wrong vulnerability names, such as calling an IDOR a “Privilege Escalation” or using “CSRF” when
it’s just unauthenticated access.

Fix:
> Refer to OWASP Top 10 and program documentation to label issues accurately. If unsure, describe the behavior
in plain terms and avoid forcing a label.


### 🌳 Using Templates Without Customization

Mistake:
> Copying and pasting from a report template and forgetting to replace generic placeholders or writing in overly
robotic tone.

Fix:
> Use templates for structure, but tailor the report to each target. Write in natural, concise, and professional
language. Always double-check for placeholders like [INSERT POC HERE].


### 🌳 Submitting Without Testing Across Browsers or Devices:- 

Mistake:
> Reporting a bug that only happens in an outdated browser or under a rare condition without confirming broader
relevance.

Fix:
> Validate that the bug works in modern, supported environments. If it's browser-specific, note that explicitly
in the report.


### 🌳 Sending Incomplete or Rushed Reports:-

Mistake:
> Reporting an issue too quickly to “beat duplicates” and sending an unfinished draft.

Fix:
> It’s better to wait 15 more minutes and submit a clean, well-structured report than a raw draft that gets
rejected. Most programs prioritize quality over speed — especially for impactful bugs.


### 🌳 Ignoring Feedback or Triage Questions:-

Mistake:
> Failing to respond when the triage team asks for clarification or missing data.

Fix:
> Monitor your reports after submission. Respond promptly and professionally. Even a simple follow-up like “Let me get that for you” builds trust and credibility.

### 🌳 Summary:
Most rejected or ignored reports fail not because the bug is invalid, but because the report is weak. Avoid 
these mistakes by thinking like a security engineer: clear steps, proper scope, correct labels, honest impact, 
and high reproducibility.
