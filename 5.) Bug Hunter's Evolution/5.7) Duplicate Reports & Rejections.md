## Dealing with Duplicate Reports and Rejections
- Getting a vulnerability report marked as a duplicate or not applicable can be frustrating, especially when
  you’ve invested significant time and effort. However, how you respond and learn from these situations is what
  defines a great bug hunter.


### 🌳 Understand What a "Duplicate" Means:- 
- A duplicate doesn't mean your report is invalid — it means someone else reported the same or similar issue
  earlier. This is common, especially with popular targets or high-signal vulnerabilities.
- Key points:

    - Programs often operate on a "first to report" basis.
    - You may still get partial credit or recognition (varies by program).
    - Don’t dispute duplicates unless you’re certain it’s a different bug.


### 🌳 Compare Your Report Carefully:- 
- Before appealing a duplicate status:

    - Compare URLs, parameters, and vulnerability types.
    - Check for nuances — was your vector different?
    - Did the other report involve a different user role, endpoint, or exploitation method?

- Tip: Frame your appeal respectfully, e.g.,
> “Thanks for reviewing. Just wanted to clarify — while this looks similar to the previous report, mine
     affects a different endpoint and uses a different role. Would it still be considered a duplicate?”


### 🌳 How to Handle "Not Applicable" or "Informative":- 
- A "not applicable", "informational", or "won’t fix" status may be given when:

    - The issue is low-risk.
    - It’s expected behavior.
    - It lacks real-world impact.

- Steps to take:

    - Reread the program’s policy. Some have strict requirements on impact.
    - Consider rewriting your report to better demonstrate risk.
    - Provide a scenario showing how it could be abused in real usage.


### 🌳 Don't Take It Personally:- 
> Triagers are human. They work with limited time, and occasionally errors happen. The key is to stay professional 
and objective. Avoid emotional language or frustration in messages.


### 🌳 Turn Duplicates into Learning Opportunities:- 
- A rejected or duplicate report can still be valuable:

    - Add it to your personal notes or recon database.
    - Use it as a pattern for other targets.
    - Study how others found it faster — what tools, techniques, or timing gave them an edge?


### 🌳 Track and Group Duplicates:- 
- Use tagging or note-taking apps to:

    - Log your duplicate reports.
    - Group them by category (XSS, IDOR, SSRF, etc.).
    - Revisit them after some time; program scope or implementation might change.


### 🌳 Understand Program Inconsistencies:- 
> Not all programs triage consistently. A bug marked "informational" in one program could be rewarded in another. 
Don't let one rejection stop you from testing that vulnerability class again.


### 🌳 Ask for Clarification — Respectfully:- 
- If you truly believe the decision was incorrect:

    - Ask for clarification professionally.
    - Provide technical evidence.
    - Avoid phrases like “You’re wrong” or “This is clearly a bug.”

- Instead try:

    - “Would it be possible to clarify why this is considered expected behavior? I'm trying to better understand
      the risk assessment here.”


### 🌳 Refine Your Signal Over Time:- 
- Frequent duplicates often mean you’re on the right track but slightly too slow or working on very obvious flaws.
  Try to:

    - Move earlier in the recon chain.
    - Dig into edge cases, chained exploits, or overlooked logic.


### 🌳 Stay in the Game:- 
> The best bug hunters have all been rejected — often. It’s persistence, not perfection, that leads to long-term 
success in bug bounty. Every "duplicate" or "N/A" sharpens your intuition for next time.


### 🌳 Summary:-
> Rejections and duplicates are part of the learning curve. Don’t let them discourage you. Use them to refine your 
process, learn from what others may have done differently, and adapt your strategy moving forward.
