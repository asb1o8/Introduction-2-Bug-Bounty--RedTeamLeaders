## Crafting Titles That Get Attention, Not Dismissals

#### 🌳 Think Like a Triage Analyst
When a triage analyst or security engineer sees your report title in a queue of hundreds, they’re scanning 
for clarity, relevance, and potential impact. Your job is to:
- Clearly state what the bug is
- Mention where it is
- Suggest why it matters (if space permits)

Bad title:
> Serious bug in the application

Good title:
> IDOR on /api/v1/users/[id] allows any authenticated user to access other users’ data


#### 🌳 Follow a Proven Format:- 
Stick to a repeatable title structure:

    [VULNERABILITY TYPE] in [FUNCTION/ENDPOINT] allows [IMPACT]

Examples:
- SSRF in /api/fetchImage leads to internal metadata access
- XSS in feedback form via unescaped “comments” parameter
- IDOR in order history API allows access to other users’ invoices
- Open redirect in login redirect parameter

This makes the bug instantly triageable.


#### 🌳 Include the Affected Endpoint or Feature
It helps teams know where to test or fix. Avoid being vague.

Instead of:

    XSS in app

Use:
> Stored XSS in `/admin/notes` through `note_title` input

If the endpoint isn’t relevant (e.g., when the vulnerability affects a business logic flaw), mention the feature name:

> Logic flaw in “Refer-a-friend” flow allows infinite rewards


#### 🌳 Avoid Emotional or Overblown Language
Words like:

    “Massive”
    “Critical”
    “Super dangerous”
    “Hackable”

…are counterproductive unless the platform marks it as critical. Stick to factual description.


#### 🌳 No Clickbait. Ever.
Clickbait-style or dramatic titles make the report feel unprofessional.

Avoid:
> I found a way to hack every user
> The whole database is exposed

These may be true, but you’ll lose credibility if the impact is not instantly verifiable.


#### 🌳 Don’t Be Afraid to Be Boring

Accuracy > Catchiness. A “boring” but precise title performs better than a vague or creative one.

Example:
> Weak JWT Secret Allows Token Forgery and Admin Access

Clear. Efficient. Trustworthy.


#### 🌳 Include Method or Vector if Known

If you know how the bug occurs, mention it briefly in the title.

Examples:

     `CSRF in password reset via missing token validation`
     `SQLi in search endpoint through “q” parameter` 

This helps the security team triage quickly and understand the nature of the issue at a glance.


#### 🌳 Short Enough for a Queue, Long Enough for Context

Try to keep titles under 120 characters if possible, but don’t remove essential context just to be brief.

This is bad:

    IDOR

This is better:

    IDOR in invoice download API allows access to other customers’ files


#### 🌳 Never Leave the Title Blank or Generic

Platforms like HackerOne might auto-fill “Bug Report” if you don’t input anything. Take time to fill this in—your title is the first impression.

Bad:

    “Bug in site”

Good:

    Open redirect in `redirect_url` parameter of login endpoint


#### 🌳 Update the Title After Confirmation or Clarification

If the triage team confirms a specific detail (e.g., that the impact includes PII or account takeover), you can update the title to reflect that.

Example:
From:

    IDOR in user profile export

To:

    IDOR in `/export_profile` exposes full PII of other users including email and phone

This adds precision and value to the record.


#### 🌳 Summary:
The title is your pitch. Write it to be read by tired eyes in a busy queue. Precision, clarity, and context always win. When in doubt, follow this pattern:

    [VULN TYPE] in [FEATURE or ENDPOINT] allows [CONSEQUENCE]
