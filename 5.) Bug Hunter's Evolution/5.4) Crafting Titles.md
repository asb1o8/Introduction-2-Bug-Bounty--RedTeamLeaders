## Crafting Titles That Get Attention, Not Dismissals

#### 🌳 Think Like a Triage Analyst
When a triage analyst or security engineer sees your report title in a queue of hundreds, they’re scanning 
for clarity, relevance, and potential impact. Your job is to:
- Clearly state what the bug is
- Mention where it is
- Suggest why it matters (if space permits)

Bad title:

    Serious bug in the application

Good title:

    IDOR on /api/v1/users/[id] allows any authenticated user to access other users’ data

2. Follow a Proven Format

Stick to a repeatable title structure:

[VULNERABILITY TYPE] in [FUNCTION/ENDPOINT] allows [IMPACT]

Examples:

    SSRF in /api/fetchImage leads to internal metadata access
    XSS in feedback form via unescaped “comments” parameter
    IDOR in order history API allows access to other users’ invoices
    Open redirect in login redirect parameter

This makes the bug instantly triageable.
3. Include the Affected Endpoint or Feature

It helps teams know where to test or fix. Avoid being vague.

Instead of:

    XSS in app

Use:

    Stored XSS in /admin/notes through note_title input

If the endpoint isn’t relevant (e.g., when the vulnerability affects a business logic flaw), mention the feature name:

    Logic flaw in “Refer-a-friend” flow allows infinite rewards

4. Avoid Emotional or Overblown Language

Words like:

    “Massive”
    “Critical”
    “Super dangerous”
    “Hackable”

…are counterproductive unless the platform marks it as critical. Stick to factual description.
5. No Clickbait. Ever.

Clickbait-style or dramatic titles make the report feel unprofessional.

Avoid:

    I found a way to hack every user
    The whole database is exposed

These may be true, but you’ll lose credibility if the impact is not instantly verifiable.
6. Don’t Be Afraid to Be Boring

Accuracy > Catchiness. A “boring” but precise title performs better than a vague or creative one.

Example:

    Weak JWT Secret Allows Token Forgery and Admin Access

Clear. Efficient. Trustworthy.
7. Include Method or Vector if Known

If you know how the bug occurs, mention it briefly in the title.

Examples:

    CSRF in password reset via missing token validation
    SQLi in search endpoint through “q” parameter

This helps the security team triage quickly and understand the nature of the issue at a glance.
8. Short Enough for a Queue, Long Enough for Context

Try to keep titles under 120 characters if possible, but don’t remove essential context just to be brief.

This is bad:

    IDOR

This is better:

    IDOR in invoice download API allows access to other customers’ files

9. Never Leave the Title Blank or Generic

Platforms like HackerOne might auto-fill “Bug Report” if you don’t input anything. Take time to fill this in—your title is the first impression.

Bad:

    “Bug in site”

Good:

    Open redirect in redirect_url parameter of login endpoint

10. Update the Title After Confirmation or Clarification

If the triage team confirms a specific detail (e.g., that the impact includes PII or account takeover), you can update the title to reflect that.

Example:
From:

    IDOR in user profile export

To:

    IDOR in /export_profile exposes full PII of other users including email and phone

This adds precision and value to the record.

Summary:
The title is your pitch. Write it to be read by tired eyes in a busy queue. Precision, clarity, and context always win. When in doubt, follow this pattern:

[VULN TYPE] in [FEATURE or ENDPOINT] allows [CONSEQUENCE]
